Lazy - delayed until needed
Eager - Immediately evaluated


Why prefer lazy?
- Computationaly expensive operations
- Large data size/ dimensionality
- Only subset of results needed at any point
- define operaiton w/o commiting to computation
- deferred execution model
- fine-grained control over timing of execution
- an abstraction central to functionla programming.
